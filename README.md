 - Extract into your noita mod folder (`C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Noita/mods/` for steam users)
 - Rename `copi.AABB-main` to `copi.AABB` **⚠ THE MOD WILL NOT WORK IF YOU SKIP THIS STEP. ⚠**

### Cloning Repository

 - If you have Github or Git on your device, then you can clone the repository directly into your noita mods folder.
 - You will not have to rename anything if you do so, and it is much easier to update the mod.
 - I suggest this method if you're good at using Git or intend on contributing to this mod.

# FAQ

 - Why is this mod not on the workshop?
   - It could do with more polish
   - Unlike triple A game studios, I only release to steam when my projects are done
   - It is a technical utility, so it is low priority. If someone needs it, they can get it here.
